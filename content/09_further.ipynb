    "## What Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have only discussed about **Supervised models**. Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, meaning each input comes with the correct output. The goal is for the model to learn to predict these labels on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pros:**\n",
    "    - High accuracy when enough labeled data is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Predictable performance and easier to evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Well-supported with mature libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cons:**\n",
    "    - Requires large, clean labeled datasets (can be expensive/time-consuming to produce).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - May overfit if not enough data or too complex a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unsupervised models\n",
    "Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The model tries to discover hidden patterns or structures in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples:** Clustering customers into groups based on purchasing behavior — the model finds structure without being told what group each customer belongs to. Another interesting example is of the **autoencoder**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pros:**\n",
    "    - Works without labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Helps with data exploration, dimensionality reduction, and pattern discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cons:**\n",
    "    - Hard to evaluate the model (no ground truth).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - May find patterns that are not meaningful or useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Often requires strong assumptions about data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Autoencoder\n",

    "#### Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is based on an agent interacting with an environment. The agent learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for actions it takes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:** Training a robot to walk or a program to play chess — it learns strategies that maximize short or long-term reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pros:**\n",
    "    - Excellent for sequential decision-making and control tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Learns directly from interaction without needing labeled datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cons:**\n",
    "    - Often slow and computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - May require a lot of exploration or simulation before learning effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Sensitive to the choice of reward structure.\n",
