# <span style="color:maroon"> Overview </span>

This is the **Machine Learning** course web page for US CMS PURSUE workshop $2025$. Given our modern day use of all things electronic, *you can run, you can hide but you cannot escape ML*. From smart phones to smart toothpastes, ML is everywhere. 

In this course, "*we're here for a good time, not a long time*" so let's first learn what this course in **NOT** for

- We are not going to learn facial recognition.
- Not going to develop a algorithm that predicts our mood better than Youtube or Netflix.
- No self-driving cars here.
- Not even making AI driven music or art.
- Nor would we learn to beat Magnus Carlsen in chess.
- and million more things, that we are not going to learn.

The main objective of this course are

- To introduce you to the basics of Machine learning with examples.
- To develop a sense of statistics/data science algorithms that goes under the hood of a ML model.
- Explain the terminology of machine learning.
- Introducing you to some **Python** frameworks to start building your first *Machine*.
- Getting familiarize with basic ML models that are although very common but can serve as a basic starting point.
- Getting you prepared to learn on your own once this course is over.


With all these let us first have some basic motivation for learning ML in the context of our pursuit of artificial intelligence.

## Aritificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

- Aritificial intelligence leverages computers and machines to mimic the problem solving and decision making capabilities of the human mind. <br>

### Machine Learning

- Machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to learn. Human experts determines the hierarchy of features to understand the difference between data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn.

- **Deep learning** in general does not require that much structuring of data and extract features without much of a human intervention. <br>

- In **classical** programming, we the developers need to understand the aspect of the problem we are trying to solve, and to know exactly what all the rules are to make it to the solution

<br>

- The standard coding algorithms that we use are constrained by statements like *if*, *do-while*, *for* etc. Even a very intelligent coder can only cover a finite number of scenarios through these.

Example: <span style="color:blue"> Self driving cars </span>

## Summary of machine learning
In a lot of sense ML can be summarised as the following

#### Rules for this workshop

- Each of the following chapter will have a [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://youtu.be/5LB_y-nudGU?si=MYDYvubUH8qLpm89) button. Clikcing on the button will open up the Jupyter Notebook in Google Collab, where you can modify and run the files as you wish. Remember that the only way to learn is to start first.

- There are questions in the jupyter lab notebooks, where the answers are hidden. But a single click would unveil the answers. The workshop will work on a *honour-system*, you are not allowed to open the answers before you are told to do so. 

>  <span style="color:red"> With all these we are now ready to proceed with the following topics.. </span>
