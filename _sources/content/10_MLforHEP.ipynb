    "Through all the other course of this workshop, you are already familiar with the scale of data that physicists have to handle.On top of that, even to know that the full experiment is going smoothly, one have to basically look at thousands of histograms per minute to draw any conclusion. ML would be helpful in both minimising the human effort, quick data mining as well as hidden feature extractions as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these huge amount of data, any full scale demonstration of ML model in HEP is not possible. One should remember that as of now the goal of ML in physics is not to replace the physics simulation but to aid it. Imagine how easy would it be if one can automate Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) through ML to get some burden away from the shifters. The goal is always to help, but not to replace physics. Any ML algorithm that might help particle physics, should itself obey the laws of physics, albeit in some obscure way. \n",

One important task is to classify different types of collisions based on their physics content, allowing physicists to find patterns in the data and to potentially unravel new discoveries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem statement:** The discovery of the Higgs boson by CMS and ATLAS Collaborations was announced at CERN in 2012. In this work, we focus on the potential of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in detecting potential Higgs signal from one of the background processes that mimics it.\n",

    "**Description:** The dataset consists of a total of 11 million labeled samples of Higgs vs background events produced by Monte Carlo simulations. Each sample consists of 28 features. The first 21 features are kinematic properties measured at the level of the detectors. The last seven are functions of the first 21."
